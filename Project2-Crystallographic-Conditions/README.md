### Project 2: Gathering Crystallographic Conditions

This is a project that gathers crystallographic conditions for a protein, using data from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). For a protein of interest, what conditions were used to crystallize similar proteins?

The PDB is a database of 3D structure information for biological macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids.
Link to the PDB: https://www.rcsb.org/

Despite my references being to their counterparts on my computer, I have also uploaded the screenshots I refer to in my Notebook.
